As the number of eliminated lines increases, the minefield will grow faster, making the game more hard and exciting. \r\n\r\nThere are three difficulty in the game. When the game is over, the player's score will be recorded in the high score list so that they can compete with other players. Players can also customize the size of the board and the number of mines. \r\n\r\n[h2]Optimized Operation [\/h2]\r\n\r\nRight-clicking will mark the square as a question mark instead of a flag. Only when the square is absolutely certain that there are no mines will it be marked as a flag, e.g. left click on a mine. \r\n\r\nRight-clicking on a number flags the flag instead of pressing the left and right buttons simultaneously. \r\n\r\nWhen you right-click the number, the game will automatically and intelligently mark the flag according to the situation of marked, unmarked squares and mines.\r\n\r\n[h2]Advanced Feature[\/h2]\r\n\r\nThe in-game help will teach you the methods, rules and techniques of minesweeping with illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe hidden AI system can automatically clear mines, helping you understand and learn the process of minesweeping.\r\n\r\n[h2]Source Code[\/h2]\r\n\r\nThis game is a completely free and open source game, everyone is welcome to play and test.
